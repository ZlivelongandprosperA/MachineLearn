# Transformations:
# - Count Vectorizer - per-word value is count (also called 'term frequency') 
#   includes lowercasing and tokenization on white space and punctuation
#   scikit-learn: sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer
#
# - TfidfVectorizer - Term-Frequency times Inverse Document-Frequency
#   Per-word value is downweighted for terms common across documents (e.g. "the")
#   scikit-learn: sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer
#
# - Hashing Vectorizer - stateless mapper from text to term index
